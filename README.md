# TFS-Companion-Reports
Team Foundation Server (TFS) Companion Reports, a sister integrated project for the TFS Companion Database, provides sample custom reports to augments -- and perhaps improve on -- the reporting package that comes with hosted TFS solutions.  These SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports are easily customizable and do not interact directly with your TFS server -- so no performance hits to worry about.
